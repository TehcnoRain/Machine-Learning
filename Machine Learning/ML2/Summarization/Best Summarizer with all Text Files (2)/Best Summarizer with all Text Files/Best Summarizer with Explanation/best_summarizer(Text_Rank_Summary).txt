In my opinion, the most effective summarizer is Text Rank Summary. While the other summarizers are decent, they often contain information that requires additional context for a comprehensive understanding. Among them, Lex Rank stands out as the least effective, presenting information in a simplistic manner almost like a child. Text Rank, on the other hand, offers a concise overview with general examples, sparking reader interest and encouraging further exploration of the article for more specific details.
