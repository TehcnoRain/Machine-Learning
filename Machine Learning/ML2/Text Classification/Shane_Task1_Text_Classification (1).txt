An atheist is one for whom all things can\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\ndetermnined.\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\nacquire intelligence, it\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\nan event can have value. \nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\nhill.\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\nestablish your values.\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\'t like it\n- that\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\nno weight in any "absolute" sense.\nThat you don\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\nor God\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\'ve been\nconditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of your\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\nI didn\'t make these rules, it\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\netc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\nweight whatsoever.\n\nBill\n'}

This is just not correct.\n\n>>The ones I read didn\'t mention anything about Jesus.  I think the issue was\n>>concerning the distinction between religion and not.\n>How could it be between religious and not religious? The motto\n>refers to god; it is a religious motto.

Provide\n>some evidence for this assertion.\n\nThat is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of\nthe USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included\nall atheists, in general, as well.  I don\'t think that any of the quotes\n(although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus.\nThey advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not\nmentioned.\n\n>>You have missed this point.  I said that the motto didn\'t say anything\n>>about anyone in particular.

It doesn\'t say that everyone trusts\n>>in some form of god, only that the nation on the whole does.\n>We have been through this before.

Based on the facts that christianity says all\n>other religions are wrong, and because it seems that the motto was\n>written by christians, I doubt your claim.\n\nSo, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions\nshould be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That\'s silly.\nI think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don\'t advocate their banishment.\n\n>[...]  Based on this idea I doubt that any additional expense would\n>even be incurred by removing the motto. Provide some evidence for your\n>claim that it would.\n\nI think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight\ncost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by\nbeing on our currency.\n\n>Disregarding the digression of the other motto...If it is used for\n>harassment, and no other purpose has been found for it, why should\n>it not be removed?\n\nWell, mottos in general don\'t really have purposes...  I don\'t think it\nshould be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the\nconsequences.\n\n>>And do you know what the vote was?  Were there other opinions?

If you do, then show why.\n>Again, it is the opinion of the people who put it there that I am\n>concerned with.\n\nThen you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.\n\n>Again, it is not necessary that the complete majority\n>shared the purpose of confronting \'godless Communism\' with this motto.\n\nWhy not?  It is the majority that put it there.\n\n>>The general public probably does not know about the anti-atheist intent\n>>of a few people in the 50\'s either.\n>I daresay more people remember the 50\'s than the time when Key wrote\n>the anthem.\n\nBut do they remember the debate surrounding the motto?  Do they remember\nthat some people intended it to be a message against atheists?  Why don\'t\nyou include this in your little survey that you were conducting?\n\n[...]\n>You claim here that scientists would believe someone\'s claims. I doubt\n>this. Provide evidence for your assertion.\n\nWhat?  Should I ask some scientists the probability that something Einstein\nsaid about relativity is worthy?
